# UFOs
### Purpose : 
In this project, we are creating Dynamic reporting page for  UFO's Sighting across the country. The goal here is to create a page where users can interact and provide input for the search field to find the right data about various UFO sightings 

### Scripting Languages and Tools :

**1.**  **JavaScript** : JS , is a high-level ,Just in time compiled, object-oriented programming language . JS is used for  creating and styling various webpages with HTML .<BR>
 **->** For this project we have used  JS library like D3, D3.js helps in dynamically manipulating the data for the websites and its emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. <BR>
**->** For filtering the data for each and if loops along with the arrow functions were used. <BR>
  
**2.** **HTML** : HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. We have created the final website using HTML and CSS .

**3.** : **CSS**  Cascading stye sheet is a language that describes the style of an HTML document. CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed <BR>

**4.** : **VS Code** : As the text Editor 

### Process: ### 

The data is filtered on five parameters 
**1.*** Date/time
**2.*** City
**3.*** State
**4.*** Country
**5.*** Shape

**Part 1 :**
Using HTML inputs tags user input is taken.  Using class and container functions a dynamic form is created and then these parameters were passed to the app.js file which is the master working file for filtering the data. <BR>

**Part 2 :** Using the functions the data is checked by passing the value as the argument to the function.  Based on the values dataset is filtered using D3 and .filter function to keep the data which matches with the argument passed to the function. A new table is created using build table function which displays the data on the website. <BR>


**Final output : **
